Hola! I am Rishi Mohan, I like designing beautiful interfaces for web and mobile. I work as UI Engineer at [BigBinary](http://bigbinary.com) in day, in night I create things like [these](/projects/), listen to music, or read Quora.  You can [read more about me here](/about/).

## What this blog is about

This blog is something I've always wanted to have and I was thinking about it since long. It's been a long time since I have been actively following blogs like [Austin Mann](http://austinmann.com/), [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), [Paul Stamatiou](https://paulstamatiou.com/), [The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/) etc. and one thing that I have learned from these blogs is the fact that **self branding is very important**, specially for someone who creates digital products. No matter if you create websites or do photography or run a shop, **if you exist on web then you need to brand yourself first**  to successfully promote any of your work. And I think the best way to go about it is by creating a personal website which shows all your work/products in one place, which is why I created this website. 

The other reason is I like writing, not as much as reading, but writing is something I definitely want to do more often. I feel it's hard to express your thoughts verbally and it's even harder to just write it down in a way that correctly represent your thoughts.

> To sum it up, if I find it interesting, it's most likely to end up on this blog.

So apart from sharing projects I work on and the crazy challenges I take, this blog is also about everything that interests me, from writing my travel stories to reviewing gear to the interesting links I find on web to the products I like. 

## Miscellany

**Setup:** The blog is running on Jekyll and hosted on Gitlab pages, thanks to my colleague, [Prathamesh](https://twitter.com/_cha1tanya) for this tip that we can setup it with a private repo on Gitlab. I've previously used Google's Blogger platform, WordPress, Tumblr etc. but after learning how Jekyll works and how easy it is to customize everything while working on [BigBinary blog](http://blog.bigbinary.com/), I really wanted to get started with Jekyll and I'm loving it.

**Design:** The website is still in early phase and there's a lot that needs to be done. I like to keep the design minimal and optimize it for better content visibility/readability. After trying lots of font combinations for better reading experience, I went with [Overpass](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass), a font that I recently discovered. Apart from that, I've a lot of ideas and you'll be seeing what those are very soon. 

**Bug Reporting/Suggestions:** If you discover any UI/functionality bug or have any kind of feedback regarding any of my work then please [let me know](mailto:hi@rishimohan.me).

And yeah, stay tuned for lots of photo blogs and awesome content.
