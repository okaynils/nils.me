Sleeping has become a good escape lately.
Once I used to sleep at 2 or 3am,
I'm dozing off before 12 these days

Not like I don't have a thing or two to do,
it's more like my mind refuses to prioritize them
when it has so much of emotional capacity missing

Makes me think about what's missing.
And I know what it is, _very very clearly_

I'm pretty sure it's same on the other side too.
And maybe that's why I keep thinking of typing a mail or two,
so I can say, **no I can't talk for 2 minutes**.
I don't want to. Because I wanted to keep talking and never stop

I wanted to sail and let the ship take me wherever it wants to.
For I considered the ship my destiny, and not the destination

Left of my mind says "_life's too short to..._" bs,
and right of it says "_remember how you were made feel_"

**And as it wasn't always, I drop the idea and put the phone back**

I'm a strong believer in expressing what one feels,
but this time I can't do that.
Trust me, I very much want to, but I can't :)

And that's when my heart says you've tried enough
