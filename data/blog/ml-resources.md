Over the course of my Data Science studies, I've come across some really valuable resources I believe have high SNR. I thought I'd share my list with other people who are interested in becoming ML engineers or students who are also enrolled in the Data Science program at FHNW.

Also, this list will stay updated so I'll add new things I find helpful over time.

## General/Basic Resources and Overwiews

- [MLU Explain](https://mlu-explain.github.io/): Nice high-level ML principles explained in a visual way.
- [Data Driven Science & Engineering](https://databookuw.com/databook.pdf): A book going over the most important principles of Algebra and Calculus for ML/DS.
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/): The holy grail of Statistical Learning. This book is really good for beginners since it covers almost all the basics that more complex types of models later build upon.
    - [Stanford STATS202](https://web.stanford.edu/class/stats202/intro.html): Accompanying to the book, this syllabus covers the main topics with quick notes on how each algorithm works. Used this heavily when revising for the Statistical Learning final.
- [Andrej Karpathy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/andrejkarpathy): You probably already know this one but I can't stress it enough; Karpathy & Chill is what gets you straight A's.
- [MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7DzL2_Na80&list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C&index=3): This playlist is a gem for anyone who's new to  university level algebra. The videos are a bit older but Gilbert Strang's way of explaining concepts is second to none.
- [Cornell CS4780 ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrLPzBxG95I&list=PLl8OlHZGYOQ7bkVbuRthEsaLr7bONzbXS): This playlist also covers the same subjects as [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/). I found Kilian Weinberger's lectures really good; he often brings a different perspective to some of the algorithms.

## More in-depth

- [Speech and Language Processing Book](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/): If you're new to natural language processing this is a good starting point. It covers pretty much everything up until Transformers.
- [An even more annotated Transformer](https://pi-tau.github.io/posts/transformer/): Amazing post on how Transformer Architectures work.
- [LLM Visualization](https://bbycroft.net/llm): An amazing 3D map of the GPT architectures, its subcomponents and how everything is connected together.
- [The Novice's LLM Training Guide](https://rentry.co/llm-training): Contains everything you need to know to train an LLM.

> Finally, just looking at these resources won't be enough. Build stuff, break things and learn.
