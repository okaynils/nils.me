excerpt: "After using iOS 12 for a week, I feel there are some nice additions. The features that I'm enjoying the most are Grouped notifications, App limits and the performance improvements. But I still feel these could've been implemented better. Also Apple could've done a lot more, but I guess they're planning for later, hopefully that'll be iOS 13."
