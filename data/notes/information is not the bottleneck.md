As I am writing this I am studying day and night for my first statistics final in my masters, coming up in five days. I do not have the heavy math background needed to ace this course. I am pondering about what I need to achieve a first principles understanding. I believe I can still manage to build such an understanding in this short amount of time but I need to figure out what the key to understanding really is.

I am not gaining much from reading the course book, it just makes me internalize what the book says and believe that its words are ground truth. Similarly, I am not gaining much from prompting an LLM, it will just rephrase what a book says in a more convenient way, according to my prompt. 

What I truly found that I needed to do is to *think*. Information about the subject is abundant but consuming it does not actually trigger understanding, it triggers memorization. 

Of course, I need to read the theory to know what I am supposed to learn, but I am taking no shortcut in skipping the thinking step. Thinking is understanding.

And I am not saying thinking is just sitting there, staring at a problem. It is about *producing* thoughts. Produce something, draw connections and dig deep.
