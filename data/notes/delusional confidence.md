Be a bit delusional. I aced most exams until now because I think that I can learn anything and achieve anything I want. But deep down, I know, that's a lie. And I know I would never do all of this if I was too realistic in my own self belief.

I am so delusional that I am managing grad school, formula student, building a startup, hanging out with friends, partying, the list goes on, at the same time. I never say no. Realistically, I can't fit all these into my calendar. Realistically, I am not putting in the time and effort needed for the results I get but I am delusional enough for it to work out. I am not going into an exam *knowing* I have not studied enough. I am going into the exam knowing that I can ace that thing if I want to. Realism limits me. Realism does not allow creativity. Realism lies to you.

Be a bit delusional and you will be surprised by what more you can achieve. You can build a damn rocket.
