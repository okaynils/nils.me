![Far, far away Soria Moria Palace shimmered like Gold - Theodor Kittelsen (1900)](/images/posts/theodor-kittelsen.jpg)

I spent a long time thinking about this annoying word in the context of my life.

Only my closest friends really know about my story but tl;dr I have had quite an unusual childhood. I grew up in a special boarding school where I have encountered many teachers and principals who doubted me throughout elementary and middle school. I was told I would never make it to a university, let alone an apprenticeship.

It was at a time where the world didn't know Minecraft yet. A friend showed me the game's first beta version and I was hooked. It made me want to become an architect. As a child it was shattering when my then teacher told me I can't reach that goal. The doubt of authority figures towards yourself quickly turn into self-doubt when you're that young.

Today I am really thankful for that doubt.

All of this made me find the joy in being tenacious and having grit. From that point onward I was on a mission to disprove anyone whoever had doubted me. When I went into high-school I started grinding for good grades, even graduating at the top of my class. At 16, I landed a software-engineering apprenticeship at one of Switzerland's biggest banks.

But that self-doubt still stuck. It wasn't about disproving my middle school teachers anymore, but rather about disproving my own self-image that has been altered by authority figures in my childhood.

Yeah, I know, this all sounds bad. But it is really not. It makes me want to push myself to the absolute edge of my capabilities because I constantly want to show myself that I am not what I was framed to be. 

There is this interesting hypothesis called the "Simulation argument" by philosopher Nick Bostrom. It is quite believable and makes sense. He says that it is inevitable that we will one day reach a technological state in which we are able to simulate life to an extent it is indistinguishable from reality. The simulation can run anything we see in real life, even multiple simulations of our current universe at the same time. If we take this thought experiment further we can argue that we might already be in one of many simulations. In fact, it is more likely than not, because there are vastly more simulations that can recursively discover the technology needed to simulate reality.

If this is true, then it means there are more versions of me that all have tiny nudges that are different. If someone watches my character in all these simulations I want to be the version of myself that tests the edge cases of the simulation. I live my life this way. Maybe the source code doesn't have unit tests for a person who was put into special ed and made it to grad school. So here I am testing the boundaries. This is my absurdist reason of *why*. I want to see how far I can come with what I have been equipped.
