# lofi.study
I've built this project during summer break 2022. 

[Lofi.study](https://lofi.study) is a little web app that allows you to mix together different sounds (e.g. soothing Rain and Thunder) to let you settle into a place of focus whenever you study or work.

Recently, I've been very busy with university and other hobbies which is why I haven't been able to continue building fun features for [lofi.study](https://lofi.study) but when I get more time I will build further addons.  

## Future Roadmap
- Make lofi.study mobile-compatible
- Add Pomodoro timer
- Add local Todolist
- Sync up with friends and study together
